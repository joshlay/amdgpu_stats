## TODO

- add unit toggle/binding; `Ghz` can be fairly vague - users may prefer `Mhz`/`Hz`
    - tldr: may be wanted for precision
    - driver provides *hertz*, with modern cards is fairly excessive
    - conversion is done using `format_frequency`
        - a wrapper of `format_size` from `humanfriendly`
        - _(currently)_ defaults to highest sensible unit, changing on scale. 
        - often flipping between `500Mhz` / `2.6Ghz` where consistency may be preferred
- address assumptions on some statistic files
    - Clocks:
        - core/memory assumed provided by `freq1_input` and `freq2_input` respectively
        - nearby files named `freq*_label` can determine this reliably
    - Voltage:
        - similarly, `in0_input` is the assumed voltage file
        - indicated by `in*_label` with `vddgfx` inside
        - no accounting for other voltage files currently; `APUs` / other cards may show more
- `argparse` extensions
    - restore `--card` / `-c` under `argparse`
        - to skip `amdgpu` device detection
        - will expect `cardN` or `renderANNN` from `/dev/dri/` 
        - provides the (AMD) GPU intended to be monitored
        - may require card/hwmon detection be separate tasks
    - preferred unit for clocks
